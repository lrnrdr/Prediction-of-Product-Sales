# Two key visuals of different types that demonstrate a relevant insight into the data.

## Visual #1

- From this graph, we can see that the Item_Type "Fruits and Vegetables" has the highest frequency sold, followed by the "Snack Foods" which are the next highest, as they are both around 14% .  I would say that they are both crucial in increasing sales.

- Here on the this heatmap, you can see that the Item Outlet Sales and Item MRP have the strongest correlation.  This shows that the Item MRP is the strongest contributor to the Item Outlet Sales, so attention to the Item MRP is crucial.
